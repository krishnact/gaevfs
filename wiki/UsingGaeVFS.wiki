#summary Getting started with GaeVFS.

= Introduction =

Before using GaeVFS you should review the [http://commons.apache.org/vfs/api.html Commons VFS API documentation]. The GaeVFS jar file contains a `vfs-providers.xml` configuration file that binds GaeVFS to the scheme `gae`. The URI format supported by GaeVFS is:

 gae://_path_

Where _path_ is a UNIX-style (or URI-style) absolute or relative path. If _path_ is a relative path (it does not start with "/"), then GaeVFS translates it to an absolute path using "/" as the root path. In practical terms, this means that relative paths and absolute paths are equivalent (the relative path `gae://mypath` is equivalent to the absolute path `gae:///mypath`). There is currently no mechanism for specifying a root path other than "/" for translating relative paths, but this may change in a future version of GaeVFS.

Examples:

  * `gae:///myfile.zip`
  * `gae:///images/picture.jpg`
  * `gae://docs/mydocument.pdf` (gets translated to `gae:///docs/mydocument.pdf` by GaeVFS)

Directory paths may be specified either with or without a trailing "/".

= Details =

In order to use GaeVFS, you *must* invoke the `GaeVFS.getManager()` static method to obtain a `FileSystemManager` instance. Then use the [http://commons.apache.org/vfs/api.html Commons VFS API] as you normally would; for example:

{{{
import org.apache.commons.vfs.FileSystemManager;
import org.apache.commons.vfs.FileObject;
import com.newatlanta.commons.vfs.provider.gae.GaeVFS;
    .
    .
    FileSystemManager fsManager = GaeVFS.getManager();
    FileObject tmpFolder = fsManager.resolveFile( "gae:///tmp" );
    if ( !tmpFolder.exists() ) {
        tmpFolder.createFolder();
    }
}}}

*WARNING!* Do not use the `VFS.getManager()` method provided by Commons VFS to get a
`FileSystemManager` when running within GAE. Commons VFS will fail to initialize and it will not work!
