#summary The Combined Local option of GaeVFS allows you to reference either local or virtual file system resources without specifying the file system scheme.

= Introduction =

Apache Commons VFS treats all file names as URIs. The scheme `file://` is used to reference files on the local file system; however, this is also the default scheme, so it may be omitted when referencing local file system resources. Examples of local file system URIs are (from the [http://commons.apache.org/vfs/filesystems.html Commons VFS documentation]):

  * `file:///home/someuser/somedir`
  * `file:///C:/Documents and Settings`
  * `file://///somehost/someshare/afile.txt`
  * `/home/someuser/somedir`
  * `c:\program files\some dir`
  * `c:/program files/some dir`

The scheme `gae://` is used by GaeVFS to reference virtual file system resources. Examples of GaeVFS file system URIs are:

  * `gae:///home/someuser/somedir`
  * `gae:///C:/Documents and Settings`
  * `gae://///somehost/someshare/afile.txt`

The Combined Local option--which is enabled by default--combines the local and GaeVFS file systems to allow you to treat them as a single file system. Specifically, the Combined Local option:

  # allows you to reference either local or GaeVFS file system resources without specifying the `file://` or `gae://` schemes
  # allows both local and GaeVFS file systems resources to use the same parent directory paths
  # treats local file system resources as read-only, while providing both read and write access to GaeVFS file system resources
  # allows you to explicitly reference a file system by specifying the `file://` or `gae://` scheme within URIs

In summary, the Combined Local option of GaeVFS allows you to write code that references both local and GaeVFS file system resources without knowing or caring which file system actually contains the resources.
